## Folder Structure
- To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.
- Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:
  - src\pages\:

    - Home.js
    - Blogs.js
    - Contact.js
    - NoPage.js
- Each file will contain a very basic React component.
