## React Router 
- A URL is the path to access a functionality. 
- Routing is like the mechanism to decide which functionality to call based on the provided URL and params. 
- So basically routing is a mapping between an URL and the functionality of a web server.
- Create React App doesn't include page routing.
- Therefore, **React Router** is the most popular solution.
## Add React Router
- To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application:
- `npm i -D react-router-dom`
## Folder Structure
- To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.
- Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:
  - src\pages\:
    - Layout.js
    - Home.js
    - Blogs.js
    - Contact.js
    - NoPage.js
- Each file will contain a very basic React component.
