## React Lists 
- Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. 
- In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.
- In React, you will render lists with some type of loop.
- The JavaScript map() array method is generally the preferred method.
